This app is a very simplified version of the scorekeeping apps available today, and a perpetual work-in-progress. The app implements a simple UI and the ability to play and score rounds at a few local courses. Rounds can be saved to history to look back on once you've completed it.

I plan on implementing a stats view which summarizes your statistics from saved rounds for some nice visual feedback on your performance over time. I'm also hoping to add a watch companion app with scoring and hopefully GPS distance capabilities, As well as exploring other iOS features such as Live Notifications and HealthKit integrations.
