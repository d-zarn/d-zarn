### HoleOut - A Golf Scorekeeping App
![HoleOutDark_256x256](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35d9600c-af0f-44ab-b52f-e79880bffa8c)

A perpetual work-in-progress. The app implements a simple UI and the ability to play and score rounds at a few local courses. So far rounds can be scored, and can be saved to history to review once you've completed it.
