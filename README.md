## Get to Know Me

- 💻 I'm an computer science undergrad currently enrolled at the University of Manitoba (U of M), with plans to graduate in April of 2026.
- 🧠 I also hold a B.Sc. in Psychology with a minor in statistics from the U of M
	- No, I will not psychoanalyze you. Or will I?
- 🏀 I'm a huge NBA fan, despite being terrible at basketball. Go Raps!
- 🏌🏼I'm also an avid golfer! I've been playing since I was around 7 years old but only recently began to take it more seriously as a sport.

## Projects

### **HoleOut** - A Golf Scorekeeping App
![HoleOutDark_256x256](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35d9600c-af0f-44ab-b52f-e79880bffa8c)

This app is a very simplified version of the scorekeeping apps available today. You can track and save your score during a round at the golf courses I've implemented and that's about it.

My motivation for making this app was the high subscription prices of many of the modern scorekeeping apps to access features like Apple Watch scoring or yardages, and advanced statistics from your past rounds. In working on this project, I immediately ran into the high costs for access to many of the databases providing golf course data and quickly connected the dots. Therefore, the only courses I’ve implemented are a few local ones that I frequent, and mapping capabilities are not yet implemented.

I have future plans to implement a watch companion app with scoring and hopefully GPS distance capabilities. As well as exploring other iOS features such as Live Notifications and HealthKit integrations.

This is my first project that wasn't assigned to me in class and also my first foray into Swift and app development. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience, with SwiftUI having pretty much everything you need to get started making apps.

This project has and will continue to teach me a lot about UI/UX design, as well as iOS and app development.

### Zones.c - Zone Based Memory Manager in C

This was an assignment for my programming practices class. We were given a header file with the required methods for the implementation, as well as multiple test files including a game our prof had written that used the memory manager.

I'll omit the details and code of my implementation as I’m unsure if this project is still used in the curriculum. Bus I’d be happy to make it available to you if appropriate.

## Current/Future Plans

Currently I’m enrolled in the following classes:

- Algorithm Analysis
- Object Orientation
- Intro to Computer Systems

Since I have all my electives covered by my prior degree, I don’t need to take anything outside of the core required courses for the degree. Given that, I’m also pursuing a minor in mathematics as I’ll have some courses to fill in my final terms.

I’m also currently working in the logistics and supply chain industry where I’m a Canadian customs import analyst. In the time I have between work and classes I’m working on a workout tracker app (basic I know, I don't want to pay for a better one), learning Rust, and everything else I can to improve as a developer and human.

I’m also in the process of applying for internships, and thinking of other fun projects.
