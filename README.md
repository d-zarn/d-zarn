# Hi, I'm Dylan

## Get to Know Me

- I'm an computer science undergrad currently enrolled at the University of Manitoba, with plans to graduate in April of 2026.
- I hold a B.Sc. in Psychology with a minor in statistics, also from the U of M
- I'm a huge NBA fan. Go Raps.
- I'm also an avid golfer. I've been playing since I was around 7 years old but only recently began to take it more seriously as a sport.

## Projects

### **HoleOut** - A Golf Scorekeeping App

This app is a very simplified version of the scorekeeping apps available today, and a perpetual work-in-progress. The app implements a simple UI and the ability to play and score rounds at a few local courses. Rounds can be saved to history to look back on once you've completed it.

I plan on implementing a stats view which summarizes your statistics from saved rounds for some nice visual feedback on your performance over time. I'm also hoping to add a watch companion app with scoring and hopefully GPS distance capabilities, As well as exploring other iOS features such as Live Notifications and HealthKit integrations.

### Zones.c - Zone Based Memory Manager in C

This was an assignment for my programming practices class. We were given a header file with the required methods for the implementation, as well as multiple test files including a game our prof had written that used the memory manager. We were then required to write our memory manager to pass all the tests given and be usable by the game.

This project taught me a lot about how memory is handled behind the scenes, as well as how to program in a test-driven manner.

I'll omit the details and code of my implementation as I’m unsure if this project is still used in the curriculum or not. But I’d be happy to make it available to you if appropriate.
